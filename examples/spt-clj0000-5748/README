This is an example fit for the cluster SPT-CLJ0000-5748, similar to
that published in Sanders+17.

Included is a hydrostatic fit with an NFW model, assuming the modified
beta form for the density. This is in fit_modified_beta_hydro.py.

There's also a non-hydrostatic version assuming a McDonald+14 form for
the temperature profile. This is in fit_modified_beta_nonhydro.py.

The input profiles are in 10 different energy bands. The ones with the
long .rebinopttwo20.s5 suffix are the rebinned ones being used in the
fits. You could use the unbinned profiles, but there may not be enough
photons in the background profiles also fitted in each radial bin. A
smooth model for the background would allow unbinned input profiles,
at the expense of speed.

The code uses 5 columns from the input foreground files: annulus
centre (arcmin), annulus half-width (arcmin), number of counts, area
of annulus (from pixels in arcmin^2), exposure time (here corrected
for vignetting). The final column is the surface brightness, but this
isn't used by the code.

From the background files, the code only uses the surface brightness
(cts/s/arcmin^2).

A Guassian prior on the background scaling is assumed.

The output files from the two programs are the MCMC chain (in HDF5
format). This contains the parameter values. The second files are
ASCII and HDF5 versions of the physical profiles with 1sigma errors.

HDF5 files can be inspected with hdfview. The data can be read using
h5py in Python. The profiles can be plotted directly using Veusz.
